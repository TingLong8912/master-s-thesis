ABSTRACT = {In the big data era, spatial positioning based on location description is the foundation to the intelligent transformation of location-based-services. To solve the problem of vagueness in location description in different contexts, this paper proposes a positioning method based on supervaluation semantics. Firstly, through combing the laws of human spatial cognition, the types of elements that people pay attention to in location description are clarified. On this basis, the source of vagueness in the location description and its embodiment in the expression form of each element are analyzed from multiple levels. Secondly, the positioning model is constructed from the following three aspects: spatial object, distance relation and direction relation. The contexts of multiple location description are super-valued, respectively, while the threshold of observations is obtained from the context semantics. Thus, the precisification of location description is realized for positioning. Thirdly, a question-answering system is designed to the collect contexts of location description, and a case study on the method is conducted. The case can verify the transformation of a set of usersâ€™ viewpoints on spatial cognition into the real-world spatial scope, to realize the representation of vague location description in the geographic information system. The result shows that the method proposed in the paper breaks through the traditional vagueness modeling, which only focuses on spatial relationship, and enhances the interpretability of semantics of vague location description. Moreover, supervaluation semantics can obtain the precisification results of vague location description in different situations, and the positioning localities are more suitable to individual subjective cognition.},
