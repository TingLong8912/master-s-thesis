   abstract = {Spatial cognitive performance is impaired in later adulthood but it is unclear whether the metacognitive processes involved in monitoring spatial cognitive performance are also compromised. Inaccurate monitoring could affect whether people choose to engage in tasks that require spatial thinking and also the strategies they use in spatial domains such as navigation. The current experiment examined potential age differences in monitoring spatial cognitive performance in a variety of spatial domains including visual-spatial working memory, spatial orientation, spatial visualization, navigation, and place learning. Younger and older adults completed a 2D mental rotation test, 3D mental rotation test, paper folding test, spatial memory span test, two virtual navigation tasks, and a cognitive mapping test. Participants also made metacognitive judgments of performance (confidence judgments, judgments of learning, or navigation time estimates) on each trial for all spatial tasks. Preference for allocentric or egocentric navigation strategies was also measured. Overall, performance was poorer and confidence in performance was lower for older adults than younger adults. In most spatial domains, the absolute and relative accuracy of metacognitive judgments was equivalent for both age groups. However, age differences in monitoring accuracy (specifically relative accuracy) emerged in spatial tasks involving navigation. Confidence in navigating for a target location also mediated age differences in allocentric navigation strategy use. These findings suggest that with the possible exception of navigation monitoring, spatial cognition may be spared from age-related decline even though spatial cognition itself is impaired in older age.},

   abstract = {Technological developments through the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) jointly with the global COVID-19 pandemic have brought about a change in life and work of almost all existing professionals. Some researchers argue how the fifth industrial revolution will approach the fourth much sooner than all previous industrial revolutions. In fact, several sources start talking about the fifth industrial revolution, although the paradigms that will define its context and areas of development are still unclear. This research study focuses on one of the foundational aspects of the fourth industrial revolution and which already has the basis for being projected into the fifth industrial revolution and thus the possibility to be taken to the next level: Human-Robot Collaboration. A state-of-the-art study and a bibliometric analysis have been carried out in order to identify research trends related to this paradigm. In addition, the authors present a definition of HRC trying to describe its main characteristics and the key aspects that identify it. In the second part of the paper, a summary of the main research trends is presented, reporting some significant case studies.},

   abstract = {An increasing number of applications for dialogue systems presuppose an ability to deal appropriately with space. Dialogues with assistance systems, intelligent mobility devices and navigation systems all commonly involve the use of spatial language. For smooth interaction, this spatial language cannot be interpreted ‘in the abstract’—it must instead be related directly to a user’s physical location, orientation, goals and needs and be embedded appropriately in a system’s interaction. This is far from straightforward. The situated interpretation of natural language concerning space, spatial relationships and spatial activities represents an unsolved challenge at this time. Despite extensive work on spatial language involving many disciplines, there are no generally accepted accounts that provide support for the kind of flexible language use observed in real human-human spatial dialogues. In this paper, I review some recent approaches to the semantics for natural language expressions concerning space in order to motivate a two-level semantic-based approach to the interpretation of spatial language. This draws on a new combination of natural language processing and principles of ontological engineering and stands as a foundation for more sophisticated and natural dialogue system behavior where spatial information is involved.},

   abstract = {In this paper we present a model based on computational intelligence and natural language generation for the automatic generation of textual summaries from numerical data series, aiming to provide insights which help users to understand the relevant information hidden in the data. Our model includes a fuzzy temporal ontology with temporal references which addresses the problem of managing imprecise temporal knowledge, which is relevant in data series. We fully describe a real use case of application in the environmental information systems field, providing linguistic descriptions about the air quality index (AQI), which is a very well-known indicator provided by all meteorological agencies worldwide. We consider two different data sources of real AQI data provided by the official Galician (NW Spain) Meteorology Agency: (i) AQI distribution in the stations of the meteorological observation network and (ii) time series which describe the state and evolution of the AQI in each meteorological station. Both application models were evaluated following the current standards and good practices of manual human expert evaluation of the Natural Language Generation field. Assessment results by two experts meteorologists were very satisfactory, which empirically confirm that the proposed textual descriptions fit this type of data and service both in content and layout.},

   abstract = {An ontology is a logical theory that accounts for a domain vocabulary’s intended meaning, allowing us to develop a computational artifact that explicitly and formally represents the community’s conceptualization related to a vocabulary. This paper presents the GeoReservoir ontology — the result of the ontological analysis of the terminology adopted by geologists in sedimentological studies about deep-marine depositional systems, which is one of the most relevant types of oil and gas reservoirs around the world. Despite the variety of studies describing the patterns of productive reservoirs, this domain demanded new approaches in conceptual modeling methodologies because the available terminology presents issues such as ambiguity and contamination of different interpretations in the terms’ definitions. Previous work has dealt with these issues in geology, resulting in the GeoCore, an ontology that explicitly defines the most generic entities in geology. However, the domain in focus still demanded a specialized ontology containing the particular terms found in reports about deep-marine deposits. GeoReservoir is an extension of GeoCore, which, in its turn, extends the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), a foundational ontology for scientific domains. GeoReservoir takes advantage of both BFO and GeoCore’s foundations, allowing us to focus our effort on defining the domain-specific entities. A team of professional reservoir geologists supported the knowledge acquisition process. We developed the ontology in iterative steps from an initial prototype to a complete artifact containing the taxonomy of entities and the relations between the entities, being increasingly refined by the experts. We further present a case study demonstrating how one could describe a depositional system in GeoReservoir terms. Moreover, we validated the ontology against defined competency questions (CQs). This work’s final result is offering a sound, consistent and unambiguous terminology to support the integration of data and knowledge about deep-marine depositional system geometry and lithology.},

   abstract = {<p>While the widely studied allocentric spatial representation holds a special status in neuroscience research, its exact nature and neural underpinnings continue to be the topic of debate, particularly in humans. Here, based on a review of human behavioral research, we argue that allocentric representations do not provide the kind of map-like, metric representation one might expect based on past theoretical work. Instead, we suggest that almost all tasks used in past studies involve a combination of egocentric and allocentric representation, complicating both the investigation of the cognitive basis of an allocentric representation and the task of identifying a brain region specifically dedicated to it. Indeed, as we discuss in detail, past studies suggest numerous brain regions important to allocentric spatial memory in addition to the hippocampus, including parahippocampal, retrosplenial, and prefrontal cortices. We thus argue that although allocentric computations will often require the hippocampus, particularly those involving extracting details across temporally specific routes, the hippocampus is not necessary for all allocentric computations. We instead suggest that a non-aggregate network process involving multiple interacting brain areas, including hippocampus and extra-hippocampal areas such as parahippocampal, retrosplenial, prefrontal, and parietal cortices, better characterizes the neural basis of spatial representation during navigation. According to this model, an allocentric representation does not emerge from the computations of a single brain region (i.e., hippocampus) nor is it readily decomposable into additive computations performed by separate brain regions. Instead, an allocentric representation emerges from computations partially shared across numerous interacting brain regions. We discuss our non-aggregate network model in light of existing data and provide several key predictions for future experiments.</p>},

   abstract = {New technology and digital transformations create disruptions for businesses, which new artificial intelligence (AI) technology is projected to do. Knowledge management (KM) and professional service firms (PSFs) play a critical role in the innovation-driven era of the knowledge economy. Both KM and PSFs rely on learning and knowledge, which are concepts that the AI-tool ChatGPT is also closely connected to. Since ChatGPT is newly launched, it is an uninvestigated phenomena. The research purpose is therefore to explore what role ChatGPT has in knowledge-creating processes within PSFs. An inductive, qualitative study is conducted through semi-structured interviews on a case study. Through thematic analysis weidentify who, how, when, and why ChatGPT is used in regards to knowledge-creating processes. The study concludes that ChatGPT is used by knowledge workers and primarily those who rely less on tacit knowledge. ChatGPT’s design results in it mainly being used for knowledge-creating processes involving explicit knowledge, and when such knowledge can be verified. Its main benefits are time efficiency and relevance.},

   abstract = {For chatbots to be broadly adopted by users, it is critical that they are experienced as useful and pleasurable. While there is an emerging body of research concerning user uptake and use of chatbots, there is a lack of theoretically grounded studies detailing what constitutes good or poor chatbot user experiences. In this paper, we present findings from a questionnaire study involving more than 200 chatbot users who reported on episodes of chatbot use that they found particularly satisfactory or frustrating. The user reports were analysed with basis in theory on user experience, with particular concern for pragmatic and hedonic attributes. We found that pragmatic attributes such as efficient assistance (positive) and problems with interpretation (negative) were important elements in user reports of satisfactory and frustrating episodes. Hedonic attributes such as entertainment value (positive) and strange and rude responses (negative) were also frequently mentioned. Older participants tended to report on pragmatic attributes more often, whereas younger participants tended to report on hedonic attributes more often. Drawing on the findings, we propose four high-level lessons learnt that may benefit chatbot service providers, and we suggest relevant future research.},

   abstract = {Today, there is a huge amount of data gathered about the Earth, not only from new spatial information systems, but also from new and more sophisticated data collection technologies. This scenario leads to a number of interesting research challenges, such as how to integrate geographic information of different kinds. The basic motivation of this paper is to introduce a GIS architecture that can enable geographic information integration in a seamless and flexible way based on its semantic value and regardless of its representation. The proposed solution is an ontology-driven geographic information system that acts as a system integrator. In this system, an ontology is a component, such as the database, cooperating to fulfill the system’s objectives. By browsing through ontologies the users can be provided with information about the embedded knowledge of the system. Special emphasis is given to the case of remote sensing systems and geographic information systems. The levels of ontologies can be used to guide processes for the extraction of more general or more detailed information. The use of multiple ontologies allows the extraction of information in different stages of classification. The semantic integration of aerial images and GIS is a crucial step towards better geospatial modeling.},

Based on the literature review, I found that the platial analysis functionalities with regard to their spatial counterparts were not sufficiently implemented yet. Therefore, more researches are needed into the development of platial operators for place-based GIS.},

   journal = {Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence},
   volume = {6},
   abstract = {Multiword expressions (MWEs) are sequences of words that pose a challenge to the computational processing of human languages due to their idiosyncrasies and the mismatch between their phrasal structure and their semantics. These idiosyncrasies are of lexical, morphosyntactic and semantic 11 nature, namely: non-compositionality, i.e., the meaning of the expression cannot be computed from the meanings of its constituents; discontinuity, i.e., alien elements may intervene; non-13 substitutability, i.e., at least one of the expression constituents is lexicalized and therefore, does not enter in alternations at the paradigmatic axis; and non-modifiability, in that they enter in syntactically 15 rigid structures, posing further constraints over modification, transformations, etc. The paper presents a model for representing MWEs at the level of semantics by taking into account all these inherent idiosyncrasies. The model assumes the form of a linguistic ontology and is applied to Greek verbal multi-word expressions (VMWEs); moreover, the semantics of the lexical entries under scrutiny is also represented via the semantics of their arguments based on corpus evidence. In this regard, modeling the semantics of VMWEs is placed in the lexicon-corpus interface.},

However, little attention has been paid to how to describe the position of a target object (TO) with a qualitative referencing system that consists of a set of reference objects (ROs) in the locality description context. We propose a method that accounts for the differences between two scenarios in locality descriptions. This method is probabilistic and is based on the Voronoi neighbor relationship to determine candidate ROs for describing a given TO's position in the second scenario. The Voronoi neighbor relationship is adopted to determine candidate ROs of a TO and to compute the neighboring area of an RO. A probability function is presented to model the uncertainty of selecting appropriate ROs. To build locality descriptions that are consistent with commonsense, four constraints are placed on the probability function. Two probability functions based on Euclidean distance and stolen-area, and a mixed probability function that considers both Euclidean distance and stolen-area, are analyzed and compared. With the mixed probability function, we establish a method to construct the locality description of a given TO. Finally, three examples demonstrate how to select ROs to describe a TO's position.},

   abstract = {Emerging transportation technologies (e.g., electric vehicles) and services (e.g., shared mobility) provide efficient, sustainable and cost-effective alternatives to traditional travel modes. However, whether these innovative technologies bring benefits to different population groups in an equal and reasonable manner is still an open question. The various methods applied to evaluate the equity performance of these systems are also not clearly comparable. In this paper, we comprehensively review methods from the existing literature for assessing the equity of a few important system outcomes: accessibility, traffic emissions, and safety. We also identify the existing challenges of analyzing equity for emerging transportation technologies. We unify the existing methodologies into a three-step framework that includes population measurement, cost/benefit measurement and equity assessment, and we summarize the applicable measurements for each step, in detail. A handful of literature focusing on emerging transportation technologies, such as shared mobility and autonomous vehicles, were also identified and surveyed; the methodologies used were found to fit with the three-step framework. We summarize the major findings and discuss promising directions for developing more sophisticated equity assessment methodologies for emerging transportation technologies. Overall, based on a comprehensive review, this paper contributes a framework for assessing the equity of transportation systems that integrates accessibility, traffic emissions, and safety outcomes. The summarized framework can be an overview resource to assist researchers and transportation planners who require equity analysis methods. The research gaps identified also provide directions for equity research on emerging transportation technologies.},

   abstract = {This paper suggests an analytical framework for the understanding of what makes places meaningful. In an interview study, respondents were asked to list places they considered important and describe what these places meant to them. The analysis of the interviews indicates that meanings spontaneously attributed to places by the respondents can be mapped around and between the three poles of self, others and environment. In addition, a number of underlying dimensions of meaning emerge: distinction, valuation, continuity and change. The relationship between these results and earlier empirical research is discussed. The paper also points out that, to a great extent, the empirical findings converge with theoretical conceptualizations of place within social science. It therefore argues that the results of empirical studies need not be limited to ‘special places’, but may also, using the suggested analytical framework, contribute to more general empirical and theoretical discussions regarding the roles and meanings of place in contemporary society.},

Pragmatic “near principles” are formulated to explain some deviations from the ideal and several other apparent irregularities of prepositional use. A set of “use types” of the ideal meaning is proposed to account for conventional aspects of locative meaning.

   abstract = {Abstract Building on abstract reference models, the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has established standards for storing, discovering, and processing geographical information. These standards act as a basis for the implementation of specific services and Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI). Research on geo-semantics plays an increasing role to support complex queries and retrieval across heterogeneous information sources, as well as for service orchestration, semantic translation, and on-the-fly integration. So far, this research targets individual solutions or focuses on the Semantic Web, leaving the integration into SDI aside. What is missing is a shared and transparent Semantic Enablement Layer for SDI which also integrates reasoning services known from the Semantic Web. Instead of developing new semantically enabled services from scratch, we propose to create profiles of existing services that implement a transparent mapping between the OGC and the Semantic Web world. Finally, we point out how to combine SDI with linked data.},

   title = {An ontology-based semantic description model of ubiquitous map images},
   journal = {Transactions in GIS},
   volume = {28},
   number = {3},
   pages = {457-485},
   abstract = {Abstract Map images with various themes and cartographic representations have become ubiquitous on the Internet. Such ubiquitously and openly accessible data, named ubiquitous map images in this study, are a potential resource for many geographic information applications such as cartographic design. However, there is a semantic gap between the simple physical form and the complex connotation of ubiquitous map images, which hinders their further applications. To mitigate such barrier, this article develops an ontology-based semantic description model for ubiquitous map images. First, we discuss the design concerns and principles of the semantic description model of ubiquitous map images. Second, three semantic layers of the semantic description model are proposed, that is, image semantic description layer, cognitive tool layer, and information source layer, and detailed semantic description items are defined for each layer. Furthermore, a formalized semantic description model for ubiquitous map images is developed using ontology construction tools, which lays the foundation for automated and fine-grained reasoning with the information embedded in map images. We construct a small test dataset consisting of weather maps, and use three types of constraints, namely “time-topic,” “region-topic,” and “map auxiliary elements” for the semantic retrieval experiments. The experiments show that the proposed semantic ontology model can enable complex semantic retrieval of ubiquitous map images. Finally, the scalability of the model is discussed from three perspectives: the depth of description, the combination with intelligent methods, and the integration with other open knowledge bases. The proposed model provides a semantic label system for applying data-driven approaches to decode ubiquitous map images, which also paves the path to the development of cartographic theory in the era of information and communications technologies.},

   abstract = {This paper explores map users' cognitive processes in learning, acquiring and remembering information presented via screen maps. In this context, we conducted a mixed-methods user experiment employing digital sketch maps and eye tracking. On the one hand, the performance of the participants was assessed based on the order with which the objects were drawn and the influence of visual variables (e.g. presence \& location, size, shape, color). On the other hand, trial durations and eye tracking statistics such as average duration of fixations, and number of fixations per seconds were compared. Moreover, selected AoIs (Area of Interests) were explored to gain a deeper insight on visual behavior of map users. Depending on the normality of the data, we used either two-way ANOVA or Mann-Whitney U test to inspect the significance of the results. Based on the evaluation of the drawing order, we observed that experts and males drew roads first whereas; novices and females focused more on hydrographic object. According to the assessment of drawn elements, no significant differences emerged between neither experts and novices, nor females and males for the retrieval of spatial information presented on 2D maps with a simple design and content. The differences in trial durations between novices and experts were not statistically significant while both studying and drawing. Similarly, no significant difference occurred between female and male participants for either studying or drawing. Eye tracking metrics also supported these findings. For average duration of fixation, there was found no significant difference between experts and novices, as well as between females and males. Similarly, no significant differences were found for the mean number of fixation.},

   abstract = {The present paper deals with the semantics of locative expressions. Our approach is essentially model-theoretic, using basic geometrical properties of the space-time continuum. We shall demonstrate that locatives consist of two layers: the first layer defines a location and the second a type of movement with respect to that location. The elements defining these layers, called localisersand modalisers, tend to form a unit, which is typically either an adposition or a case marker. It will be seen that this layering is not only semantically but in many languages also morphologically manifest. There are numerous languages in which the morphology is sufficiently transparent with respect to the layering. The consequences of this theory are manifold. For example, we shall show that it explains the contrast between English and Finnish concerning directionals, which is discussed in Fong (1997). In addition, we shall be concerned with the question of orientation of locatives, as discussed in Nam (1995). We propose that nondirectional locatives are oriented to the event, while directional locatives are oriented to certain arguments, called movers.},

   abstract = {Geographic information systems (GIS) are a widely used approach for geodata manipulation, analysis, and geoinformation visualization. Although the issue of semantic heterogeneity for GIS applications has been widely addressed, the development of flexible semantic GIS systems can still be improved, and GIS interfaces can be further unified to enhance system understanding among users of various GIS systems. This study proposes an ontology-based semantic GIS conceptual framework that can seamlessly combine ontology models, GIS elements and user actions for semantic GIS application development. In addition, a GIS components ontology that encompasses the five fundamental components of GIS is proposed to integrate GIS elements that can perceive GIS operations and processes semantically and to support customized GIS system designs. Moreover, a semantic WebGIS implementation framework is designed on the basis of the proposed conceptual framework to facilitate semantic WebGIS development. The implementation uses two common application scenarios regarding urban change analysis and user interaction. The former performs semantic retrieval for urban change analysis with system understanding, whereas the latter conducts online thematic mapping with semantic interpretation. The study contributes in terms of innovation in the design of a unified GIS components ontology and successful implementation of a semantic GIS system using the ontology-driven approach, thereby providing a convincing demonstration of the latter and showing the potential for semantic GIS application paradigms.},

Compared to a univariate visualization, it is significantly harder to read regional differences and spot geographical outliers. Especially targeting inexperienced users of visualizations, we advocate the use of natural language text for augmenting map visualizations and understanding the relationship between two geo-statistical variables. We propose an approach that selects interesting findings from data analysis, generates a respective text and visualization, and integrates both into a single document. The generated reports interactively link the visualization with the textual narrative. Users can get additional explanations and have the ability to compare different regions. The text generation process is flexible and adapts to various geographical and contextual settings based on small sets of parameters. We showcase this flexibility through a number of application examples.},

   pages = {14-27},
   abstract = {Wildfire evacuation trigger points are prominent geographic features (e.g., ridge lines, rivers, and roads) utilized in timing evacuation warnings. When a fire crosses a feature, an evacuation warning is issued to the communities or firefighters in the path of the fire. Current methods for generating trigger buffers have limited utility because the resulting buffers are not explicitly tied to prominent geographic features, making it difficult to visually determine when a fire has breached a trigger point. This work aims to address this limitation by using reverse geocoding to identify prominent geographic trigger points that have more value to emergency managers. The method consists of three steps: 1) generate a trigger buffer using fire-spread modeling; 2) utilize online reverse-geocoding to retrieve geographic features proximal to the buffer boundary; and 3) identify the most prominent geographic features using viewshed analysis and compute the warning time each would offer given predicted fire spread rates to proximal communities. A case study of Julian, California is presented to identify prominent geographic trigger points that may have value to emergency managers in improving the timing of wildfire evacuation warnings in this region.},

   abstract = {As a form of important domain knowledge, large-scale ontologies play a critical role in building a large variety of knowledge-based systems. To overcome the problem of semantic heterogeneity and encode domain knowledge in reusable format, a large-scale and well-defined ontology is also required in the traditional Chinese medicine discipline. We argue that to meet the on-demand and scalability requirement ontology-based systems should go beyond the use of static ontology and be able to self-evolve and specialize for the domain knowledge they possess. In particular, we refer to the context-specific portions from large-scale ontologies like the traditional Chinese medicine ontology as sub-ontologies. Ontology-based systems are able to reuse sub-ontologies in local repository called ontology cache. In order to improve the overall performance of ontology cache, we propose to evolve sub-ontologies in ontology cache to optimize the knowledge structure of sub-ontologies. Moreover, we present the sub-ontology evolution approach based on a genetic algorithm for reusing large-scale ontologies. We evaluate the proposed evolution approach with the traditional Chinese medicine ontology and obtain promising results.},

If the database is large, this could help significantly in speeding search by reducing the size of the necessary search space. This paper builds upon past work to develop a model for determining the directional relationship in 2-D space between two simply-connected polygons of arbitrary shape, size and distance from each other. The model is based on visual interpretation and is data structure independent. The model is also stated in algorithmic terms, and is found to have a computational complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of vertices or cells used to represent the two polygons.},

   abstract = {<p>Knowing who we are, and where we are, are two fundamental aspects of our physical and mental experience. Although the domains of spatial and social cognition are often studied independently, a few recent areas of scholarship have explored the interactions of place and self. This fits in with increasing evidence for embodied theories of cognition, where mental processes are grounded in action and perception. Who we are might be integrated with where we are, and impact how we move through space. Individuals vary in personality, navigational strategies, and numerous cognitive and social competencies. Here we review the relation between social and spatial spheres of existence in the realms of philosophical considerations, neural and psychological representations, and evolutionary context, and how we might use the built environment to suit who we are, or how it creates who we are. In particular we investigate how two spatial reference frames, egocentric and allocentric, might transcend into the social realm. We then speculate on how environments may interact with spatial cognition. Finally, we suggest how a framework encompassing spatial and social cognition might be taken in consideration by architects and urban planners.</p>},

   abstract = {Human spatial concepts, such as the concept of place, are not immediately translatable to the geometric foundations of spatial databases and information systems developed over the past 50 years. These systems typically rest on the concepts of objects and fields, both bound to coordinates, as two general paradigms of geographic representation. The match between notions of place occurring in everyday where questions and the data available to answer such questions is unclear and hinders progress in place-based information systems. This is particularly true in novel application areas such as the Digital Humanities or speech-based human–computer interaction, but also for location-based services. Although this shortcoming has been observed before, we approach the challenges of relating places to information system representations with a fresh view, based on a set of core concepts of spatial information. These concepts have been proposed in information science with the intent of serving human–machine spatial question asking and answering. Clarifying the relationship of the notion of place to these concepts is a significant step toward geographically intelligent systems. The main result of the article is a demonstration that the notion of place fits existing concepts of spatial information, when these are adequately exploited and combined.},

   journal = {Computers, Environment and Urban Systems},
   volume = {77},
   pages = {101349},
   abstract = {Reverse geocoding is a process that maps coordinates to a set of location identifiers such as addresses or toponyms. What makes the reverse geocoding process challenging is the uncertainty of the position being asked and the point features used to represent places. In recent years, due to advances in locating technologies, large amounts of location-based data have been produced in location-based social networks such as the Yelp, Foursquare, and Swarm. These data are a rich source of information about the patterns of people's behaviors in different places. In this paper, with the help of these data, the enhancement of spatial distance-only reverse geocoding has been attempted. The main purpose of this paper is to develop and validate an algorithm for matching categories in the Yelp and Swarm services. In this way, the data from the Yelp were used for generating temporal behavior data and the data from Swarm were used for collecting check-in data. Since the data from Yelp and Swarm services have different categorization structures, integrating these two structures was one of the main challenges of our study. After matching the categories of Yelp and Swarm services, the obtained temporal behavior data for all data sets of Yelp were used in the process of reverse geocoding for Swarm check-in data.

   abstract = {Reverse geocoding is a process that maps coordinates to a set of location identifiers such as addresses or toponyms. What makes the reverse geocoding process challenging is the uncertainty of the position being asked and the point features used to represent places. In recent years, due to advances in locating technologies, large amounts of location-based data have been produced in location-based social networks such as the Yelp, Foursquare, and Swarm. These data are a rich source of information about the patterns of people's behaviors in different places. In this paper, with the help of these data, the enhancement of spatial distance-only reverse geocoding has been attempted. The main purpose of this paper is to develop and validate an algorithm for matching categories in the Yelp and Swarm services. In this way, the data from the Yelp were used for generating temporal behavior data and the data from Swarm were used for collecting check-in data. Since the data from Yelp and Swarm services have different categorization structures, integrating these two structures was one of the main challenges of our study. After matching the categories of Yelp and Swarm services, the obtained temporal behavior data for all data sets of Yelp were used in the process of reverse geocoding for Swarm check-in data. In our study, linear, rational and sinusoidal functions were used for distorting the spatial distance with temporal check-in probability in the process of reverse geocoding. In addition, two sets of data include training and test data were used for determining the parameters of the model and validating the results. In this way, it was found that by combining a linear model with temporal behavior data, the results of spatial distance-only reverse geocoding can be improved by 29.96% for the Mean Reciprocal Rank index (a statistical measure for evaluating any process that produces a list of responses, ordered by probability of correctness) and 105.73% for the First Position index (which counts the number of correctly identified POIs).

   abstract = {Many research topics in natural language processing (NLP), such as explanation generation, dialog modeling, or machine translation, require evaluation that goes beyond standard metrics like accuracy or F1 score toward a more human-centered approach. Therefore, understanding how to design user studies becomes increasingly important. However, few comprehensive resources exist on planning, conducting, and evaluating user studies for NLP, making it hard to get started for researchers without prior experience in the field of human evaluation. In this paper, we summarize the most important aspects of user studies and their design and evaluation, providing direct links to NLP tasks and NLP-specific challenges where appropriate. We (i) outline general study design, ethical considerations, and factors to consider for crowdsourcing, (ii) discuss the particularities of user studies in NLP, and provide starting points to select questionnaires, experimental designs, and evaluation methods that are tailored to the specific NLP tasks. Additionally, we offer examples with accompanying statistical evaluation code, to bridge the gap between theoretical guidelines and practical applications.},

They are a reflection of epistemology; different ontologies emerge to describe identical spatial entities based on diverging ways of knowing the world. Different points of view result in different spatial ontologies. Formalization is the process of translating ideas and spatial entities into computable form. Ontologies are the basis of the resultant circumscribed logical universe. One computing system can accommodate multiple ontologies—or points of view. Understanding ontologies is the key to accommodating difference within a computing environment. Spatial ontologies enable multiple stakeholders to represent their data with different scenarios and interpretations of the geographical world. Spatial ontologies are also a way of embedding context into geographic information system (GIS) and cartography. Each ontology is implicitly a point of view and enables the map user or reader to understand that different classifications are associated with different agenda.},

   abstract = {The rapid expansion and integration of robots in the service industry have transformed the way services are delivered. With service robots increasingly replacing frontline human staff, the dynamics of service encounters have shifted from human-to-human to human-to-robot interactions, thereby significantly impacting the process of value co-creation. The active involvement of customers in co-creating value with these robots becomes crucial for the successful implementation of robotic services. Drawing upon social perception theory, we investigate the influence of service robots' proactivity on customers' willingness to engage in value co-creation and delve into the underlying mechanisms. Three studies were conducted across diverse service settings, each involving different service robots. Consistently, the findings demonstrate that customers display a greater inclination to co-create value with proactive service robots. The proactive behavior exhibited by these robots substantially enhances customers' perceptions of warmth and competence. Importantly, these effects are observed across various service scenarios and customer segments, including both premium and regular customers, thus affirming the robustness and generalizability of our findings. Our research provides practical guidance for practitioners involved in the implementation of service robots. Additionally, theoretical advancements and suggest potential directions for future research are discussed.},

The paper presents data from an elicitation study that shows how speakers can access multiple senses and hyponymy relations for the vocabulary items belonging to these categories. The paper shows that while prepositions can potentially cover different spatial relations in the opportune context (e.g., zai “at”), localisers select increasingly specific senses (e.g., qian “front” and qian-mian “front side”). The paper also shows how speakers can access hyponym-like sense relations emerging from these patterns (e.g., qian-bian covering a more specific sense than qian). Semantic dimensions such as “distance” and “location type” determine the strength of these hyponymy relations. The paper offers an account of these data based on the “semantics maps” model, which captures polysemy and hyponymy patterns via the clusters of locations they refer to. It is shown that this novel model is consistent with previous works on the polysemy of spatial categories and sheds light on how Mandarin offers a unique organisation of this domain.},

   abstract = {The goal of this paper is to offer a unified account of Place as a central theoretical notion across different disciplines. We show that while psychology, geography and other sciences have been converging to a unified view of this notion, linguistics still offers a fragmented perspective. Consequently, place names lack a full-fledged analysis that connects this category to the psychological concept of place. We propose to overcome this impasse by introducing a multi-modal Discourse Representation Theory (DRT) account of place as a conceptual construct and place concepts as specific instances of this construct. We show that current variants of DRT permit us to model place names and their senses, i.e., the meaning(s) that individuals associate with Sydney. We then model non-linguistic place concepts, i.e., the mental representation(s) that individuals can have of the city carrying this name. We present a model of the relation between linguistic meaning and conceptual content via the notion of anchoring relations applied to place. We pair this formal treatment with a morpho-syntactic account of place names building on current generative syntax treatments of proper names. Once we have a morpho-syntactic and semantic model of place names, we use a frame semantics treatment to account for lexical relations among place names. We test the overarching model on a set of recalcitrant problems afflicting current linguistic and multi-disciplinary treatments of place. These are the grammatical complexity and lexical content of place names, place concepts and their networks, and inter-subjective, communicative models of place in discourse. By solving these problems, our account integrates several frameworks (DRT, conceptual analysis, generative syntax, frame semantics) and connects several disciplines (linguistics, psychology, geographic information science, communication models) via a novel, multi-modal account of place. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and empirical import of these results.},

This is called co-learning, conceptualized in this paper as comprising two alternating iterative stages: partners adapting their behavior to the task and to each other (co-adaptation), and partners sustaining successful behavior through communication. This paper focuses on the first stage in human-robot teams, aiming at a method for the identification of recurring behaviors that indicate co-learning.

The observations revealed patterns of interaction used by human and robot in order to adapt their behavior to the task and to one another. Results therefore show that our task environment enables us to study co-learning, and suggest that more participant adaptation improved robot learning and thus team level learning. The identified interaction patterns can emerge in similar task contexts, forming a first description and analysis method for co-learning. Moreover, the identification of interaction patterns support awareness among team members, providing the foundation for human-robot communication about the co-adaptation (i.e., the second stage of co-learning).

   abstract = {This paper describes a system for service robots that combines ontological knowledge reasoning and human–robot interaction to interpret natural language commands and successfully perform household chores, such as finding and delivering objects. Knowledge and context reasoning is essential for providing more efficient service robots, given their diverse and continuously changing environments. Moreover, since they are in contact with humans, robots require such skills as interaction and language. Therefore, we developed a system with specific modules to manage robots’ knowledge and reasoning, command analysis, decision-making, and talking interaction. The system relies on inference methods and verbal interaction to understand commands and clarify uncertain information. We tested our system inside a simulated environment where the robot receives commands with missing or unclear information. The system’s performance was compared with the average performance of human subjects who completed the same commands in the simulation.},

   abstract = {A place reflects the collective cognition of the geographical extent and semantics of a named spatial domain, acting as a vital reference to a particular space in daily discourse. Boundaries and toponyms are essential identifiers of places. Frameworks that are efficient in real-world boundary determination of cognitive places are still missing. The emergence of a large amount of geotagged user-generated content (geo-UGC) offers new opportunities to model the place boundaries from a more human-centric perspective. However, the broad geographical scales of places and the noise in geo-UGC data conflict with traditional approaches that only focus on places with similar spatial extents. In this paper, we advocate considering spatial hierarchy when determining place boundaries. We propose the Hierarchical Place Detector (HPD), a framework that composes noise detection, spatial hierarchy reconstruction, and boundary extraction, to rebuild the boundaries and spatial hierarchy of places from geo-UGC. The HPD is a state-of-the-art framework for determining and organizing place boundaries by the spatial hierarchy, thereby preserving morphology and geographical relationships among places. The hierarchical boundaries could be fundamental analytical units in various downstream applications, including spatial visualization, geographical information retrieval, navigation services, and spatial interaction modelling.},

   abstract = {Direction relations between spatial objects have been a research focus in different fields like spatial reasoning, spatial query, GIS, CAD/CAM, and AI. A novel model named Radial model is proposed to obtain both quantitative and qualitative direction relations based on the principle of the ray transmitting as a straight line. The framework of the proposed model is composed of reference point, reference, and target object. Theoretically, we group direction relations into three cases (case I: point/point; case II: point/line and point/area; case III: line/line, line/area and area/area) for calculation based on point-set theory. Additionally, we employ the model in calculating direction relations on the vector and raster spatial data model in GIS.},

The provision of a context-contingent translation mechanism between linguistic proximity measures (e.g. “near”, “far”) and metric distance measures is an important topic in current GIS research. After a discussion of context factors that mediate the relationship between linguistic and metric distance measures, we present a statistical approach, Ordered Logit Regression, to the context-contingent proximity modeling. The approach can predict proximity given the corresponding metric distance and context variables. An empirical case study with human subjects is carried out using this statistical approach.

   abstract = {The notion of proximity is one of the foundational elements in humans' understanding and reasoning of the geographical environments. The perception and cognition of distances plays a significant role in many daily human activities. Yet, few studies have thus far provided context–contingent translation mechanisms between linguistic proximity descriptors (e.g., “near,”“far”) and metric distance measures. One problem with previous fuzzy logic proximity modeling studies is that they presume the form of the fuzzy membership functions of proximity relations. Another problem is that previous studies have fundamental weaknesses in considering context factors in proximity models. We argue that statistical approaches are ill suited to proximity modeling because of the inherently fuzzy nature of the relations between linguistic and metric distance measures. In this study, we propose a neurofuzzy system approach to solve this problem. The approach allows for the dynamic construction of context–contingent proximity models based on sample data. An empirical case study with human subject survey data is carried out to test the validity of the approach and to compare it with the previous statistical approach. Interpretation and prediction accuracy of the empirical study are discussed.},

   volume = {11},
   number = {1},
   abstract = {In the big data era, spatial positioning based on location description is the foundation to the intelligent transformation of location-based-services. To solve the problem of vagueness in location description in different contexts, this paper proposes a positioning method based on supervaluation semantics. Firstly, through combing the laws of human spatial cognition, the types of elements that people pay attention to in location description are clarified. On this basis, the source of vagueness in the location description and its embodiment in the expression form of each element are analyzed from multiple levels. Secondly, the positioning model is constructed from the following three aspects: spatial object, distance relation and direction relation. The contexts of multiple location description are super-valued, respectively, while the threshold of observations is obtained from the context semantics. Thus, the precisification of location description is realized for positioning. Thirdly, a question-answering system is designed to the collect contexts of location description, and a case study on the method is conducted. The case can verify the transformation of a set of users\&rsquo; viewpoints on spatial cognition into the real-world spatial scope, to realize the representation of vague location description in the geographic information system. The result shows that the method proposed in the paper breaks through the traditional vagueness modeling, which only focuses on spatial relationship, and enhances the interpretability of semantics of vague location description. Moreover, supervaluation semantics can obtain the precisification results of vague location description in different situations, and the positioning localities are more suitable to individual subjective cognition.},

   abstract = {漢語中有許多表達處所與方位的「方位詞」，但文獻中不僅缺乏明確的定義，其所屬詞類與其詞態屬性也多有爭議。本文的目的是對以上議題提出系統性的分析。我們首先利用介詞「在」要求處所論元的特性來界定方位詞，並指出方位詞在語意上的完整指稱需依賴其先行詞。處所詞倒置的句法構式則提供了進一步驗證方位詞的方法。我們接著檢視方位詞詞態屬性的三種可能：（自由）詞、附著語素、詞綴。以連接詞、簡答與插入「的」等三項測試所得到的結果是：單音節方位詞主要是附著語素，而非詞綴，僅在有限的環境中是詞；雙音節與多音節方位詞則都是詞。而在詞類的歸屬上，本文論證所得的結論是方位詞均有名詞的特徵，並非後置詞，也不應視為獨特的詞類。 In Chinese linguistics, "localizers" is an accepted term referring to a set of morphemes indicating the relative location or place of an object; however, not only is a precise definition not available in related literature, but the precise syntactic category and morphological status of localizers are both controversial. The purpose of this paper is to examine these issues systematically and offer a comprehensive and insightful account. We first define a localizer as the locative argument of preposition zai's 在 "at," whose reference relies on a preceding nominal antecedent. The locative inversion construction then serves as a further test for localizers. As for their morphological status, we examine the three possibilities: word, clitic, and affix. The results of three different tests, namely conjunction, short answer, and de 的 insertion, show that localizers with two or more syllables are all words, while monosyllabic localizers are in general clitics, except in highly restricted contexts where some may be words. All localizers are nominals, thus being neither postpositions nor another independent syntactic category.},
